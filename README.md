# Spotify-Stock-Profile
Spotify Stock Profile - Python Visualizations Project

In this project, I have used programming language Python to visualize Spotify stock data.
In finance, a _stock profile_ is a series of studies, visualizations, and analyses that dive into different aspects a publicly traded company's data. 

I have visualized data for whole quarters of 2018/2019. Specifically, I have created the following visualizations:
+ The distribution of the stock prices for the past quarters
+ The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the last quarters
+ Spotify's earnings and revenue in the past quarters
+ A comparison of the Spotify Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price


During this project, I have analyzed, prepared, and plotted data. My visualizations can help assess the risk of the Spotify stock.
As the last step I have created a presentation to share.
